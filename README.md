Coursera video downloader
=========================

Horribly rough - first project in Scala; doesn't accept nearly any input at all, or display download progress.

Will automatically download all videos from SaaS course and Model Thinking course without prompting. Downloads all in parallel. Requires username and password. Will not download if file of same size and name is found.

Run using java -jar downloader.jar
